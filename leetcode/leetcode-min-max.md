## Min-max Problems

> Refer to: [Minimax and Maximin Optimization](http://apmonitor.com/me575/index.php/Main/MiniMax)
>
> A minimax problem seeks to minimize the maximum value of a number of decision variables. It is sometimes applied to minimize the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario.
>
> A maximin problem maximizes the minimum value. It is used to maximize the minimum objective (such as profit or revenue) for all potential scenarios.

Usually, we have two strategies to solve Min-max or max-min problems.
